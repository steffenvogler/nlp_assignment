# General

Assignment of a NLP sentiment analysis. Along the project I will try to implement as many solutions as possible (given the time). At the end we can compare accuracies of each approach.

## Overview
The following paragraphs descibe (i) data input, (ii) training on Jupyter notebook, (iii) training inside docker container (the proper way for CI/CD), and strategies for data output.

Please see the following flow chart for an overview. [Link](./doc/SageMaker_en_detail.pdf)
